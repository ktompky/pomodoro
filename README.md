### Pomodoro timer can be as simple or as complex as you would like for it to be.

# Super simple version

### snagged from here - https://dev.to/code_jedi/create-a-simple-pomodoro-timer-in-python-l97
#
### This verson laid out in pomodoro.py is basic, but gets the job done.  When you run the code, it starts the pomodoro work section of the timer. Once that's complete, it will give you a break and then go back into the work cycle. Each time it completes that cycle of work and break, the count increased by 1. 
#
### There is no way to pause the timer nor is there a way to stop the timer beyond ctrl + c to interrupt the while loop.
#
### Ways you can customize this script to personalize it. 
- Change the sleep timer to be your own time
- Change the messaging for the pomodoro start, the break start, and the work end.
- Change the code to set a specific number of work cycles.
